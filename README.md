# Deep Learning – Wide Residual Networks on CIFAR-10

The project focuses on training Wide Residual Networks (WRNs) and evaluating their performance on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-C datasets, with and without **mixup data augmentation**.

---

## Project Overview

The project objectives include:

-  Reading and analyzing a WRN research paper
-  Reproducing models from the paper using PyTorch
-  Training and evaluating WRNs on the CIFAR-10 dataset
-  Comparing performance with and without **mixup augmentation**
-  Evaluating robustness on CIFAR-C (corrupted test images)

---

## Tools & Technologies

- Python
- PyTorch
- Torchvision
- Matplotlib, NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## Files

- `deep_learning_cifar10_wrn.ipynb` – Main notebook with WRN implementation, training results, and analysis.
